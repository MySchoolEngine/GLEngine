# GLEngine

This project started as OpenGL engine, which I wanted to derive from my Bachleor thesis. But right now I am aiming to easy to setup engine for my school projects with capability to setup OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX context.

## Setup
git clone https://github.com/RohacekD/GLEngine

cd GLEngine

git submodule init

git submodule update
