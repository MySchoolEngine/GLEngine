# GLEngine

## Disclaimer

Project is going intentionally wrong way right now, cause I am runnign short on time in my school assignments. When I will finish my assignments I will take it back to multithreadable way.

This project started as OpenGL engine, which I wanted to derive from my Bachleor thesis. But right now I am aiming to easy to setup engine for my school projects with capability to setup OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX context.

## Setup
git clone https://github.com/RohacekD/GLEngine

cd GLEngine

git submodule init

git submodule update
