## [Unreleased] - 13-02-2025

Goal of this branch was to create water simulation. Unfortunatelly I have faild and want to move on. One day I will be hopefully able to continue.

### Added
- `GLEngine::GLRenderer::C_WaterRendering` Water simulator
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_PhysicsRenderer` Rendering for 2D physics
- `GLEngine::Renderer::IndirectDraw`
- `GLEngine::Renderer::IndirectDrawIndexed`

### Changed
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_ImageViewer`
    - `SetBackground()`
    - `AddOverlay()`
    - `ShowLayers()` to show layers in sidebar
        - Possibility to hide image or overlay

### Fixed
- Keep shader name when hot reload
- `GLEngine::Renderer::MeshData::C_Geometry::CreatePlane` Now generates correct plane.
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_CPURasterizer::DrawCircle` Correct blending of the alpha channel.
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_CPURasterizer::ScanLineFloodFill` Correct blending of the alpha channel.
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_CPURasterizer::BresenhamHorizontal` Correct blending of the alpha channel.
- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_CPURasterizer::XiaolinWu` Correct blending of the alpha channel.

## [Unreleased] - 22-12-2024
### Added
- `GLEngine::GUI::C_ResourceDialogWindow` generic resource file dialog

## [Unreleased] - 17-11-2024

This version started long ago and aimed for more API agnostic approach to rendering. Aiming for rendering through handles and allow me to optimase the rendering in the future without writing API specific code.

### Added

- `GLEngine::Renderer::ResouceManager` to manage GPU resources.
- `Utils::Reflection::MetaGUI::Texture` first example how to write GUI for `GLEngine::Core::ResourceHandle<T>`
- `GLEngine::Core::Filesystem` for usual path used across engine for unification

### Changed

- `GLEngine::Renderer::C_Material` GUI now allows setting textures
- `GLEngine::Editor::C_ImageEditor` works with handles
- `GLEngine::Core::C_ResourceManager::s_UpdatesBeforeDelete` timeout to unload unused resources
